    <div class="manchtextm">
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement made
        between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you”) and
        Manch ("Company", “we”, “us”, or “our”), concerning your access to and
        use of the Manch App as well as any other media form, media channel,
        mobile App or mobile application related, linked, or otherwise connected
        thereto (collectively, the “App”). We are registered in India and have
        our registered office at 18229, IIM Lucknow, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh
        226013. You agree that by accessing the App, you have read, understood,
        and agree to be bound by all of these Terms and Conditions. IF YOU DO
        NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY
        PROHIBITED FROM USING THE APP AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the
        App from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by
        reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes
        or modifications to these Terms and Conditions at any time and for any
        reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last
        updated” date of these Terms and Conditions, and you waive any right to
        receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you
        check the applicable Terms every time you use our App so that you
        understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed
        to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any
        revised Terms and Conditions by your continued use of the App after the
        date such revised Terms and Conditions are posted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information provided on the App is not intended for distribution to
        or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such
        distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which
        would subject us to any registration requirement within such
        jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access
        the App from other locations do so on their own initiative and are
        solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent
        local laws are applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App is intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All
        users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside (generally
        under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly
        supervised by, their parent or guardian to use the App. If you are a
        minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these
        Terms and Conditions prior to you using the App.
